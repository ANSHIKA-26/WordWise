# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of this community, pledge to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone. We recognize the richness that diverse backgrounds bring and commit to fostering an inclusive environment for all, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We strive to act and interact in ways that promote an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We recognize that our community thrives on collaboration and respect, and we commit to upholding these values in all interactions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness**: Actively listen and respond to others with compassion and respect.
* **Respecting differing opinions**: Acknowledge and appreciate diverse viewpoints and experiences, even when they differ from your own.
* **Providing constructive feedback**: Offer suggestions for improvement in a supportive manner, and be open to receiving feedback yourself.
* **Taking responsibility**: Own up to mistakes, apologize sincerely, and learn from the experience to foster personal and community growth.
* **Prioritizing community well-being**: Consider the impact of your actions on the community as a whole, promoting a culture of collaboration and mutual support.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Using sexualized language or imagery**: Avoid any form of sexual advances or language that objectifies others.

* **Sharing private information**: Respect the privacy of others; do not share personal information without consent.
* **Inappropriate conduct**: Avoid any behavior that could reasonably be considered unprofessional or unwelcome, including intimidation or coercion.

Leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, contributions, or communications that do not align with this Code of Conduct. When necessary, they will communicate the reasons behind moderation decisions to maintain transparency.
