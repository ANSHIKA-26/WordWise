# Blogging Website

## Project Overview

This project is a fully functional **Blogging Website** that allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts. The website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide a simple, yet engaging user interface and experience. It can be extended with a backend (such as Node.js, Python, or PHP) to handle server-side logic, authentication, and database storage.

The purpose of this project is to give developers a starting point for building blog platforms, showcasing how to structure a website with HTML for content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The website is mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes using responsive design techniques.
2. **Post Creation**: Users can create new blog posts through a form with fields like title, content, and image.
3. **Post Management**: The blog displays a list of all created posts, with the ability to delete or update posts.
4. **Post Viewing**: Each blog post is displayed on a separate page, with details like the post date, title, content, and author.
5. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for blog posts by keywords or title using JavaScript search logic.
6. **Comment System (Basic)**: Users can leave comments on blog posts, which are dynamically added to the page.
7. **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
8. **Form Validation**: The input fields for creating a blog post are validated using JavaScript to ensure proper data entry.
