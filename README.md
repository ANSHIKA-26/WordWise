Since I'm unable to access live websites directly, I recommend verifying the live version of your project on GitHub Pages by opening the link in your browser. You can review the changes there yourself, such as the navbar updates and 3D effects.

For the README file, I'll update it to include the correct image link:



# WordWise - Blogging Website

WordWise is a simple and intuitive blogging website where users can create, share, and read blogs on various topics. The goal of this project is to provide a minimalistic and engaging platform for writers and readers.

## Features

- **Navbar Updates**: The navigation bar has been refined to offer an improved user experience. It's easy to navigate with quick access to key sections.
  
- **Secondary Title Centered on Image**: The secondary title has been centered on the main image to enhance the visual appeal, making the website look more professional and aligned.

- **3D Image Effect**: The main image now has a 3D effect, adding a modern and dynamic look to the page, creating a more engaging user interface.
